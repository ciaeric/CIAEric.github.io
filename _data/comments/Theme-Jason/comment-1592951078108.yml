message: "Today, I went to the beach front with my kids. I found a sea shell and gave it to my \r\n4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She put the shell to her ear and screamed.\r\n\r\nThere was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her ear.\r\nShe never wants to go back! LoL I know this is \r\ncompletely off topic but I had to tell someone!"
