message: "I believe what you published made a ton of sense. But, think about this, what if \r\nyou composed a catchier post title? I am not saying your content isn't solid, but what \r\nif you added a title that makes people desire more?\r\nI mean How to Setup Your Own Theme of PowerBI Reports is kinda vanilla.\r\nYou could look at Yahoo's home page and see how they \r\ncreate post titles to grab viewers interested.\r\nYou might add a video or a picture or two to get readers \r\ninterested about what you've got to say. In my opinion, it might make your blog a \r\nlittle livelier."
