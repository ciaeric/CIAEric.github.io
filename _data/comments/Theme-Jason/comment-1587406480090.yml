message: "Today, I went to the beach front with my children. I found a sea shell and \r\ngave it to my 4 year old daughter and said \"You can hear the ocean if you put this to your ear.\" She \r\nput the shell to her ear and screamed. There was a hermit crab inside and it pinched her \r\near. She never wants to go back! LoL I know this is completely off \r\ntopic but I had to tell someone!"
