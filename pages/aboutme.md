<i class="fa fa-address-card" aria-hidden="true"></i> Hi there, my name is Eric Dong, and Chinese Name is 董经纬. The reason why I pick Eric as my English Name is because of [**_Eric Clapton_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton) and his song <i class="fa fa-youtube-play" aria-hidden="true"></i>[**_Tears in Heaven_**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxPj3GAYYZ0), though we were born in totally different ages.

<i class="fa fa-map-marker" aria-hidden="true"></i> I moved to Australia in 2015 from China Mainland, and now I am currently living in Brisbane which is located in Queensland - [**_A Sunshine State_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland)
